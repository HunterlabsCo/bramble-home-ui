  "paragraph2": "The cryptocurrency, when used for voting / liking / sharing / purchasing / paying, will make the transaction secure and authentic. The award will be based purely on fame, usage, likability, etc. of the purpose or product. The backlinks created are going to be the price of Bramble.

  "whySubtitle": "Other companies restrict users by awarding for their loyalty and not for their actions in real-time. And cryptocurrencies today have become more of an alternative to real cash where the only bitcoin is decentralized in a true sense. The computational power of backlinks is never taken into account which at the time plays a very important role in the overall valuation of any cryptocurrency. We are simply rewarding people for their contribution to this computational power & creation of backlinks.",
