  "whySubtitle": "Other companies restrict users by awarding for their loyalty and not for their actions in real-time. And cryptocurrencies today have become more of an alternative to real cash where the only bitcoin is decentralized in a true sense. The computational power of backlinks is never taken into account which at the time plays a very important role in the overall valuation of any cryptocurrency. We are simply rewarding people for their contribution to this computational power & creation of backlinks.",
